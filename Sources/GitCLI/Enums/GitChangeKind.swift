/// The same vocabulary is used at two granularities:
/// - **File level** — one value per changed file, from ``Git/status(repoRoot:)``.
/// - **Line level** — for editor gutter markers, from ``Git/lineChanges(for:repoRoot:)``.

    /// A file staged for addition, or a line that did not exist at `HEAD`.
    case added

    /// A tracked file or line whose contents differ from `HEAD`.
    case modified

    /// A tracked file removed from the working tree, or — at line granularity —
    /// the surviving line directly below a pure deletion.
    case deleted

    /// A file not yet tracked by git.
    case untracked

    /// A tracked file that git detected as renamed.
